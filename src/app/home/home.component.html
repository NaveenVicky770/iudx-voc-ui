     <h1>About IUDX Vocabulary</h1>
     <p> voc.iudx.org.in is a shared vocabulary that details schemas for structured
        data exchange via IUDX data exchange APIs. The creation and maintenance of
        voc.iudx.org.in schemas is intended to be a collaborative activity.
     </p>
     <p>
        A shared vocabulary along with a data exchange standard has the potential to
        enable data interoperability, functional extensibility and information
        exchange across silos (application verticals, city departments etc.).
        Further, shared vocabulary allows intelligent applications and data
        consumers to understand semantic meaning of attributes and entities
        entailing the IUDX specification.
     </p>
     <p>
        The schema used to specify voc.iudx.org.in is derived from the Resource
        Description Framework (RDF) schema. Apart from standard properties from
        RDFS, additional properties have been defined to specify vocabulary
        components. For example, similar to schema.org, additional properties like
        ‘domainIncludes’ and ‘rangeIncludes’ have been used to allow associating a
        property with multiple domains and ranges.
     </p>
     <p>voc.iudx.org.in consists of:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>
           <img src="/assets/bullet.png" />Set of ‘types’ (or
           ‘classes’) representing structured data objects. These ‘types’ are
           organized into single inheritance hierarchies using the ‘rdfs:subclassOf’
           property from RDF Schema.
        </li>
        <li>
           <img src="/assets/bullet.png" />Set of ‘properties’ where
           each property may have one or more types as its domain which implies that
           this property may be present in the instances belonging to any of the
           domain types. Further, each property may have one or more types as its
           range which implies that the value objects for this property should be an
           instance of at least one of the range types. Additional properties like
           ‘exactMatch’ may be used to provide additional linkings to already known
           properties from other vocabularies.
        </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
        For example, a data model can be represented as a ‘type’ and is associated
        with all the properties that include this data model type in its domain.
     </p>
     <p>voc.iudx.org.in uses JSON-LD to represent vocabulary objects.</p>
