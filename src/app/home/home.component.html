        About IUDX Vocabulary
      </h2>
      <p> voc.iudx.org.in is a shared vocabulary that details schemas for structured data exchange
        via IUDX data exchange APIs. The creation and maintenance of voc.iudx.org.in schemas is intended to be a
        collaborative activity.
      </p>
      <p> A shared vocabulary along with a data exchange standard has the potential to enable data
        interoperability, functional extensibility and information exchange across silos (application verticals, city
        departments etc.). Further, shared vocabulary allows intelligent applications and data consumers to understand
        semantic meaning of attributes and entities entailing the IUDX specification.
      </p>
      <p> The schema used to specify voc.iudx.org.in is derived from the Resource Description
        Framework (RDF) schema. Apart from standard properties from RDFS, additional properties have been defined to
        specify vocabulary components. For example, similar to schema.org, additional properties like ‘domainIncludes’
        and ‘rangeIncludes’ have been used to allow associating a property with multiple domains and ranges.

        What dose it consists of?
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Set of ‘types’ (or ‘classes’)
          representing structured data objects. These ‘types’ are organized into single inheritance hierarchies using
          the ‘rdfs:subclassOf’ property from RDF Schema.
        </li>
        <li>Set of ‘properties’ where each
          property may have one or more types as its domain which implies that this property may be present in the
          instances belonging to any of the domain types. Further, each property may have one or more types as its range
          which implies that the value objects for this property should be an instance of at least one of the range
          types. Additional properties like ‘exactMatch’ may be used to provide additional linkings to already known
          properties from other vocabularies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> For example, a data model can be represented as a ‘type’ and is associated with all the properties that
        include this data model type in its domain. </p>
      <p>voc.iudx.org.in uses JSON-LD to represent vocabulary objects.</p>
