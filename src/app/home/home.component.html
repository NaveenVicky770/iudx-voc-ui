  <h1>About IUDX Vocabulary</h1>
  <p>
    voc.iudx.org.in is a shared vocabulary that details schemas for structured
    data exchange via IUDX data exchange APIs. The creation and maintenance of
    voc.iudx.org.in schemas is intended to be a collaborative activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    A shared vocabulary along with a data exchange standard has the potential to
    enable data interoperability, functional extensibility and information
    exchange across silos (application verticals, city departments etc.).
    Further, shared vocabulary allows intelligent applications and data
    consumers to understand semantic meaning of attributes and entities
    entailing the IUDX specification.
  </p>
  <p>
    The schema used to specify voc.iudx.org.in is derived from the Resource
    Description Framework (RDF) schema. Apart from standard properties from
    RDFS, additional properties have been defined to specify vocabulary
    components. For example, similar to schema.org, additional properties like
    ‘domainIncludes’ and ‘rangeIncludes’ have been used to allow associating a
    property with multiple domains and ranges.
  </p>
  <p>voc.iudx.org.in consists of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <img class="bullet" src="/assets/bullet.png" />Set of ‘types’ (or
      ‘classes’) representing structured data objects. These ‘types’ are
      organized into single inheritance hierarchies using the ‘rdfs:subclassOf’
      property from RDF Schema.
    </li>
    <li>
      <img class="bullet" src="/assets/bullet.png" />Set of ‘properties’ where
      each property may have one or more types as its domain which implies that
      this property may be present in the instances belonging to any of the
      domain types. Further, each property may have one or more types as its
      range which implies that the value objects for this property should be an
      instance of at least one of the range types. Additional properties like
      ‘exactMatch’ may be used to provide additional linkings to already known
      properties from other vocabularies.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For example, a data model can be represented as a ‘type’ and is associated
    with all the properties that include this data model type in its domain.
  </p>
  <p>voc.iudx.org.in uses JSON-LD to represent vocabulary objects.</p>
