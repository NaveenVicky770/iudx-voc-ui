      <h2>About IUDX Vocabulary</h2>
      <p>
        voc.iudx.org.in is a shared vocabulary that details schemas for
        structured data exchange via IUDX data exchange APIs. The creation and
        maintenance of voc.iudx.org.in schemas is intended to be a collaborative
        activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        A shared vocabulary along with a data exchange standard has the
        potential to enable data interoperability, functional extensibility and
        information exchange across silos (application verticals, city
        departments etc.). Further, shared vocabulary allows intelligent
        applications and data consumers to understand semantic meaning of
        attributes and entities entailing the IUDX specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        The schema used to specify voc.iudx.org.in is derived from the Resource
        Description Framework (RDF) schema. Apart from standard properties from
        RDFS, additional properties have been defined to specify vocabulary
        components. For example, similar to schema.org, additional properties
        like ‘domainIncludes’ and ‘rangeIncludes’ have been used to allow
        associating a property with multiple domains and ranges.
