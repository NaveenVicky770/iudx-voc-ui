      <h2>Why AgriJSON?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="pt-lg-3 text-align-justify">
          The global community faces the huge problems of hunger and
          malnutrition, with an estimated 800 million empty plates in 2021 and
          3.1 billion undernourished persons in 2021. Digital Agriculture can
          transform the production, productivity, quality and distribution of
          food. Digital transformation requires data – right data to the right
          people/ systems in the right time. This is possible only of we can
          break the data silos and enable seamless interoperability of food
          systems. AgriJSON resolves the ‘data challenges’ through semantic
          interoperability.

      <h2 id="aboutAgriJson">About AgriJSON Vocabulary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="pt-lg-3 text-align-justify">
          AgriJSON is a schema for representation of a wide range of
          agricultural data. <span>agrijson.org</span> is a shared vocabulary
          that details schemas for structured agricultural data exchange via
          data exchange(DX) APIs. The creation and maintenance of agrijson.org
          schemas is intended to be a collaborative activity. A shared
          vocabulary along with a data exchange standard has the potential to
          enable data interoperability, functional extensibility and information
          exchange across silos (application verticals, departments etc.).

      <ul>
        <li class="text-align-justify">
          Further, shared vocabulary allows intelligent applications and data
          consumers to understand the semantic meaning of attributes and
          entities entailing the ADeX specification. The schema used to specify
          agrijson.org is derived from the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
          schema. Apart from standard properties from RDFS, additional
          properties have been defined to specify vocabulary components. For
          example, similar to schema.org, additional properties like
          ‘domainIncludes’ and ‘rangeIncludes’ have been used to allow
          associating a property with multiple domains and ranges.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What does it consist of?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="pt-lg-2 text-align-justify bullet">
          Set of ‘types’ (or ‘classes’) representing structured data objects.
          These ‘types’ are organized into single inheritance hierarchies using
          the ‘rdfs:subclassOf’ property from RDF Schema
        </li>
        <li class="pt-lg-4 text-align-justify bullet">
          Set of ‘properties’ where each property may have one or more types as
          its domain which implies that this property may be present in the
          instances belonging to any of the domain types. Further, each property
          may have one or more types as its range which implies that the value
          objects for this property should be an instance of at least one of the
          range types. Additional properties like ‘exactMatch’ may be used to
          provide additional linkings to already known properties from other
          vocabularies.
        </li>

        <li class="pt-lg-4 text-align-justify">
          For example, a data model can be represented as a ‘type’ and is
          associated with all the properties that include this data model type
          in its domain. agrijson.org uses JSON-LD to represent vocabulary
          objects.
