    <h2 class="mt-lg-5">Why AgriJSON?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="pt-lg-3 text-align-justify">
        The global community faces the huge problems of hunger and malnutrition,
        with an estimated 800 million empty plates in 2021 and 3.1 billion
        undernourished persons in 2021. Digital Agriculture can transform the
        production, productivity, quality and distribution of food. Digital
        transformation requires data – right data to the right people/ systems
        in the right time. This is possible only of we can break the data silos
        and enable seamless interoperability of food systems. AgriJSON resolves
        the ‘data challenges’ through semantic interoperability.

    <h2 id="aboutAgriJson">About AgriJSON Vocabulary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="pt-lg-3 text-align-justify">
        AgriJSON is a schema for representation of a wide range of agricultural
        data. <span>agrijson.org</span> is a shared vocabulary that details
        schemas for structured agricultural data exchange via data exchange(DX)
        APIs. The creation and maintenance of agrijson.org schemas is intended
        to be a collaborative activity. A shared vocabulary along with a data
        exchange standard has the potential to enable data interoperability,
        functional extensibility and information exchange across silos
        (application verticals, departments etc.). Further, shared vocabulary
        allows intelligent applications and data consumers to understand the
        semantic meaning of attributes and entities entailing the ADeX
        specification. The schema used to specify agrijson.org is derived from
        the Resource Description Framework (RDF) schema. Apart from standard
        properties from RDFS, additional properties have been defined to specify
        vocabulary components. For example, similar to schema.org, additional
        properties like ‘domainIncludes’ and ‘rangeIncludes’ have been used to
        allow associating a property with multiple domains and ranges.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="ps-lg-4">
      <h3>What does it consist of?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="pt-lg-2 text-align-justify bullet">
          Set of ‘types’ (or ‘classes’) representing structured data objects.
          These ‘types’ are organized into single inheritance hierarchies using
          the ‘rdfs:subclassOf’ property from RDF Schema
        </li>
        <li class="pt-lg-4 text-align-justify bullet">
          Set of ‘properties’ where each property may have one or more types as
          its domain which implies that this property may be present in the
          instances belonging to any of the domain types. Further, each property
          may have one or more types as its range which implies that the value
          objects for this property should be an instance of at least one of the
          range types. Additional properties like ‘exactMatch’ may be used to
          provide additional linkings to already known properties from other
          vocabularies.
        </li>

        <li class="pt-lg-4 text-align-justify">
          For example, a data model can be represented as a ‘type’ and is
          associated with all the properties that include this data model type
          in its domain. agrijson.org uses JSON-LD to represent vocabulary
          objects.
