      <h2>AgriJSON</h2>
      <ul class="ps-lg-5">
        <li>
          AgriJSON is a schema that provides a standard method of defining the
          semantics and for representation of agricultural data and enables a
          seamless exchange across the ecosystem of digital agriculture.
        </li>
        <li>
          The concept of AgriJSON was developed by Mr Satyanarayana Jeedigunta,
          Chief Advisor, C4IR India. The version 1.0 of AgriJSON schema has been
          developed by a team of IISc, Bengaluru.
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently, AgriJSON is developed on a 3-level taxonomy - Concepts,
          Categories and Types. The five concepts of AgriJSON are: Entity,
          naturalResource, Process, Service and Calssification. They consist of
          36 data models, each consisting of 10 to 25 attributes and
          representing a usable dataObject. Some of the technical details are
          given below:
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">
          AgriJSON Schema can be accessed at https://agrijson.org
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">
          AgriJSON has been developed using JSON-LD standard.
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">
          The schema is useful to developers for designing interoperable systems
          in digital agriculture It is proposed that the AgriJSON Schema can be
          expanded in a phased manner to consist of about 100 dataObjects that
          across the entire spectrum of digital agriculture.

      <h2>Agricultural Data: Critical for Sectoral Transformation</h2>
      <p class="ps-lg-5">
        According to an estimate of NASSCOM, the annual economic potential of
        agricultural data is US$ 65 billion in India. The global projection may
        be much larger. The potential can be realized through multiple methods â€“
        like digital services, analytics, AI-based predections, innovation and
        research. The economic potential of data lies along the entire value
        chain spanning across crop planning, crop management, logistics and
        marketing. The variety of agricultural data is wide as it deals with
        several complex aspects like land, soil, seed, crop, pest, disease,
        weather, market, machinery, devices, chemicals, quality, traceability
        and exports. Most often the data is required to be near real-time to be
        fit for purpose
      </p>
      <p class="ps-lg-5">
        Agriculture sector produces immense data. The emerging practices like
        smart farming, precision farming and climate smart agriculture are
        pushing up the volumes of data produced and consumed. IDC has assessed
        that currently in US, an average farm with a size of over 400 hectares,
        produces 0.5 million data points every day. This number is estimated to
        grow to 4 million by 2036. However, data can deliver on its promise of
        economic transformation only if it is of the right quality,
        standards-based, structured, and interoperable. Otherwise, data can
        become a burden instead of being an asset.

    <div class="row mt-lg-4">
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p class="ps-lg-5">
        While the value of data is well recognized, the data ecosystem faces
        several challenges. The data is sioled. We do not have a data standard
        for agriculture like for healthcare which has FHIR (HL7) standard. This
        has led to the the challenge in exchange of the data. As a result, the
        potential of data lies untapped with its owners, while the innovators,
        researchers, and service providers grope or struggle for that data.
        Besides the difficulties in exchange of data, the non-standard
        representation of agricultural data makes It unsuitable for
        machine-to-machine interchange, readability, and interpretability. This
        is a huge barrier to designing, developing, and delivering efficient
        digital services to the stakeholers.

      <h2>The Opportunity</h2>
      <ul class="ps-lg-5">
        <li>
          An open standard for defining and representing agricultural data can
          unleash a huge potential currently latent in agricultural data at
          rest. The opportunity can be realized by pursuing multiple efforts of
          standardization along the data life cycle. These includes
          standardizing the vocabulary (already accomplished by the AGROVOC
          initiative of FAO), defining the semantics of agricultural data,
          developing
          <strong
            >a standard method for representation or serializtion of
            data,</strong
          >
          and the protocol for exchanging data. Significant opportunities lie in
          pursuing latter three ideas. Seamless interchange of agricultural data
          opens the following opportunities.
